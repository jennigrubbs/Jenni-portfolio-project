# Jenni-portfolio-project
Jenni Grubbs' first portfolio project during Thinkful

This project was created for a lesson in the Thinkful engineering flex program. It is a first solo website building attempt.

Jenni Grubbs is the creator of this website. During the website's creation, Jenni was a student at Thinkful.

This website would not be possible without the resources provided by Thinkful, help from mentor Charles Driver and assistance from relative Jeff Baumgardt, who is a software developer and a Thinkful mentor.
